The Pop

released August 31, 2025


From testing fusions with Rock genres to mixing everything with Jazz and complicate drums, this album was planned to have an only side, but it was so fun to compose it that it became one of the most satisfactory and complete digital music works I have ever made.

By Iago 'Akai Keisanki' Alves Dias.
