Essential Synonym

released August 8, 2025


'Essential Synonym', a remix album by Iago 'Akai Keisanki' Alves Dias, derived from the authorial Fusion album 'Essential Antonym', originally produced to test the use of multiple instruments together.

Antonyms carry the concept of their antonyms,
so every antonym is essentially the negative concept of all synonyms,
but it does not mean that a negation can silence its essence.
Nevertheless,
every word has a different interpretation of its essential antonym,
which, if perfect, is a perfect allusion to it,
the only thing that can represent it completely, if not itself;
the only essential synonym.
A perfect antonym resembles an exact word like no other,
just like an essentially complete synonym should.
